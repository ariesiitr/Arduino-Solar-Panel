# Arduino-Solar-Panel
Recruitment Project for 1st Year
To increase the efficiency of solar panels to absorb more of solar intensity to
generate more energy we have deviced a mechanism of 2 degree of freedom movement
of the solar panel so that it becomes perpendicular to the direction of light as
that helps to absorb the maximum flux thus increasing efficiency.
