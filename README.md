# Arduino-Solar-Panel

The purpose of this project is to examine how a system of light sensors can be used
as a solar tracker for a solar panel. The goal is to capture as much sun energy as
possible and to maximise the efficiency.



To increase the efficiency of solar panels to absorb more of solar intensity to
generate more energy we have deviced a mechanism of 2 degree of freedom movement
of the solar panel so that it becomes perpendicular to the direction of light as
that helps to absorb the maximum flux thus increasing efficiency.



For this we use Arduino UNO, servo motors,  Solaar panel, LDR sensors and some basic electrical equipments.



Procedure:
The LDR detects the falling sunlight. These generate analogue signals, which are sent
to the Arduino board. The Arduino board calculates as to where the intensity
(Efficiency) is maximum, then accordingly the servo motors position the solar panels
so that the plane of the solar panel is perpendicular to the incoming light rays. Thus,
the intensity is maximized.
